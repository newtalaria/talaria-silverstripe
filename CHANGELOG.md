## [Unreleased]

## [3.0.0] - 2026-10-30

### Changed

- Breaking: requires `talaria/talaria` ^3.0. Keys, ingest host, routes, and auth follow the TIS hard cut in the core 3.0.0 changelog.
- Breaking: `TALARIA_API_KEY` is a secret `tal_sk_` key. `tal_live_` keys are rejected.
- Breaking: the `dsn` setting and `TALARIA_DSN` are removed, along with the cloud DSN default. The ingest host comes from the key's cell. YAML `url` or `TALARIA_URL` is the only override.
- Breaking: the browser key is set with YAML `browser_api_key` (was `browserApiKey`) or `TALARIA_BROWSER_API_KEY`, and it must be a publishable `tal_pk_` key. The server key is never injected, so browser inject is skipped when no valid `tal_pk_` key is set.
- Breaking: `browserDsn` and `TALARIA_BROWSER_DSN` are removed. The browser uses `TALARIA_URL` or the host derived from its key.
- Breaking: SiteHost monitors register with `POST /v1/monitors/{slug}/check-ins` using the `tal_sk_` key. Cron lines and `talaria-sitehost-probe` check in with a `tal_mon_` token (was `tal_ping_`) on `POST /v1/check-ins` with `Authorization: Bearer`. `pingToken` is now `monitorToken`. Run `vendor/bin/talaria-sitehost install` again after upgrading.
- SiteHost log collection moved to the deploy action. `vendor/bin/talaria-sitehost install` reconciles monitors and the probe only.

## [2.1.3] - 2026-10-09

### Fixed

- The SiteHost log collector keeps lines that have no severity. Collector 0.162 treats `on_error: send` as a failure, so those lines were dropped.

## [2.1.2] - 2026-10-09

### Added

- `vendor/bin/talaria-sitehost install` downloads otelcol-contrib 0.162.0 and adds a supervisord program that tails the container's Apache error, PHP-FPM, cron, and SiteHost logs to `POST /otlp/v1/logs`. The API key stays in the process environment.

## [2.1.1] - 2026-10-09

### Added

- `vendor/bin/talaria-sitehost install` reconciles `talaria/sitehost/monitors.json` into one crontab block and one supervisord probe program. A second run reuses ping tokens. Invalid config and a failed registration exit non-zero.

## [2.1.0] - 2026-10-09

### Added

- `bin/talaria-sitehost-probe` reports the supervisord program, free disk, and whether named environment variables are set, and sends container gauges.
- Requires `talaria/talaria` ^2.1.0 for `Talaria::monitor`.

## [2.0.1] - 2026-10-03

### Changed

- Default `browserSdkVersion` is **0.5.3**.

## [2.0.0] - 2026-10-01

### Changed

- Breaking: remove the `environment` setting and `TALARIA_ENVIRONMENT`. The API key decides the environment. Browser init no longer sends `environment`.
- Requires `talaria/talaria` ^2.0.0.
- Default `browserSdkVersion` is **0.5.0**.

## [1.2.3] - 2026-09-29

### Added

- Optional `browserApiKey` / `TALARIA_BROWSER_API_KEY`. When set, CMS admin and public pages report with that project key. PHP keeps `TALARIA_API_KEY`.

### Changed

- MySQL queries use the shared SQL span helper. Identical statements under one parent roll up, and `withoutQuerySpans` turns those spans off for one run.
- Requires `talaria/talaria` ^1.2.3.

## [1.2.2] - 2026-09-29

### Fixed

- Uncaught exceptions logged by Monolog are captured once, with structured frames. The shutdown handler no longer sends a second event whose stack trace is the message.

### Changed

- Requires `talaria/talaria` ^1.2.2.

## [1.2.1] - 2026-09-27

### Changed

- An empty DSN defaults to `https://ingest.newtalaria.com`.
- Default `browserSdkVersion` is **0.4.1**.
- Package docs point at the marketing guides.

## [1.2.0] - 2026-09-27

### Changed

- Default `browserSdkVersion` is **0.4.0**. Tracing, replay, analytics, and heatmaps follow the project policy document. Public pages call `analytics.optIn()` when that policy allows analytics.
- Requires `talaria/talaria` ^1.2.0.

## [1.1.1] - 2026-09-24

### Changed

- Default `browserSdkVersion` is **0.3.0**. With `enableAnalytics` on, `@newtalaria/browser` 0.3.0 also sends click and scroll heatmaps.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-09-22

### Added

- YAML / `TALARIA_ENABLE_ANALYTICS` `enableAnalytics` (default off). Enables PHP `Talaria::analytics()` and passes `enableAnalytics` to the public-page browser inject. CMS admin is not opted in.
- Request middleware binds the current Member as `userId` when analytics is on so server-side `track` works for logged-in visitors.

### Changed

- Default `browserSdkVersion` is **0.2.2** (`Talaria.analytics` on `@newtalaria/browser`).
- Requires `talaria/talaria` ^1.1.1.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-09-21

### Added

- First release as `talaria/silverstripe` (Silverstripe 4.13+ / 5 / 6 vendormodule) depending on `talaria/talaria`.
- Injector + Monolog (1/2 vs 3 handlers), browser SDK inject, request/MySQL/Guzzle/QueuedJobs tracing YAML.
